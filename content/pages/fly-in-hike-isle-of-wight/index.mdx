## Part 1: Redhill to Bembridge. Ribs for lunch.

Isle of Wight, the largest island in England, is located south of London, roughly 40 mins away from the mainland by a ferry. Our hike around Isle of Wight has been planned well in advance. Hence, I was not expecting to get a message from Georgios, a few days before the hike, saying that his friend will be more than happy to give us a "lift" to the Isle of Wight's Bembridge airport and have lunch with us there.

Our trip started in Redhill airport, a small airport near London with an all-grass runway. The plane was already waiting for us, just in front of a hangar. We left the hiking equipment in the cabin and our pilot, Theo, led us for the pre-departure briefing. The pre-flight tasks included checking the weather, planning the route, contacting the destination airport about our planned arrival, and checking for airspace closures due to the Platinum Jubilee celebrations. All of that went smoothly and I thought that we are good to go. But the issues begun when we started figuring out the mass distribution, and our estimated takeoff and landing weight. The plane was marginally within the limits. Also, when checking manually, the extended-range fuel tanks had more fuel than what was reported in the aircraft logbook - reason being that the fuel indicator displayed maximum of 13 gallons, but the long-range tanks on our aircraft had 19 gallons capacity. After long 2 hours of talking to the air club members it was agreed to take out all the unnecessary cargo from the plane (including extra weight to balance the plane when flying solo). Then we double checked that we are within the limits and finally we got a green light for the takeoff from Theo, our pilot.

The weather was great for flying, it was sunny with a bit of clouds with great visibility. After taking off we quickly reached Eastbourne and then turned west towards Brighton. The clouds stayed away from the sea due to the pressure difference. Flying along the coast we enjoyed the great cloudless conditions and a stunning view so we took the opportunity to do some sharper turns, dives and climbs to feel the g force. The best part was when I got the controls and was able to steer the plane for a bit for a first time in my life - a truly remarkable experience.

We reached Bembridge airport on Isle of Wight after roughly 45 mins in the air. Just before the landing, our pilot took a long turn offering us a great view of the island. We landed smoothly and parked the plane on the airfield next to many other small planes of people who flew in here to relax. The pub was just next to the airport. We had the famed ribs for lunch, meanwhile other planes were landing and taking off close by. After lunch we parted our ways with Theo and begun our hike, aiming to reach the Needles in 3 days.

## Part 2: The Hike

Hike map

Our hike started in the late in the afternoon, the goal for the day was to reach (…) 10 km away and spend the night wild camping in the forest. At first we felt quite lost as we had to cross quite a few fences on our way. Fenced fields for sheep are common on the British coast, I don’t think anything could be grown on such a type of land.
Once we reached the coastal path there were designated gates allowing hikers to pass through the fields easily. We followed the path and go to bigger towns …. where we got pizza for dinner.

The Isle of Wight cliffs are made of clay (?) which doesn’t hold up well against erosion, therefore the landslides happen here quite often. When walking we could see many cracks suggesting that the sea fights to take the land piece by piece. The camping spot where we supposed to spend the first night was out of reach for us since the path leading there was closed because of a recent landslide. As a precautionary measure I would suggest avoiding camping directly on or below the cliffs in case of landslides.

On the day two of our adventure we got to AONB (Area of Outstanding National Beauty), a big piece of land, stretching all the way from southern part of the island to the Needles. One thing we haven’t accounted for is the fact that there are not many places to get food around. There were a few pubs marked on Google Maps not so far from the coast. Drinking the finest British ales and eating classics such as fish and chips made us survive the rest of our trip. The south western part of the island offers the best views and the real feel of nature as there are no big towns up there. You can spend all day hiking along the cliffs with the sea on your side.

We spend the second night on the campsite () ran by a very nice old couple. We could already see the faint white colored cliffs to the west, the Needles, our goal. Initially we planned to camp one more night before ending the hike, but because of forecasted storm we stretched our journey to 35kms, got to the Needles for the sunset and luckily we were just in time to catch the last ferry which took us inlands.
