When I joined Yelp in 2020, I became part of the Ranking Platform team as a software engineer. The team is responsible for the development and maintenance of Yelp’s search and ranking infrastructure, a crucial part of our ecosystem, that allows for business search, reviews search and powers the internal real-time ad bidding system.

At that time, I was part of an initiative to revamp our core search & ranking infrastructure in terms of performance and cost efficiency. This effort resulted in an open-source search engine - nrtSearch - which, as of early 2023, is used for the majority of search and ranking use cases at Yelp.
