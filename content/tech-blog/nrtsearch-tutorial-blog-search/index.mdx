Let's use [nrtsearch](https://github.com/Yelp/nrtsearch) - an open-source search engine built by Yelp - to support text search for any website. In this tutotial, I'm using my blog as an example dataset, but you can use this approach to index anything accessible on the web, like wikipedia or an internal company wiki.

We will begin by building a simple web crawler to fetch your websites data. Then we will start a local, standalone nrtSearch instance, desing its index schema and set up an indexing pipeline to feed the data into the search engine. Finally, we will define nrtsearch queries to support custom scoring and highlighting. We will be able to interact with the system via a search UI. All of this will be done with minimum coding, I will make use of open-source projects to keep things simple and extensible.

If you want to learn more about the nrtSearch you can read the Yelp's Engineering blog post: [Nrtsearch: Yelpâ€™s Fast, Scalable and Cost Effective Search Engine](https://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2021/09/nrtsearch-yelps-fast-scalable-and-cost-effective-search-engine.html). Let's start!

## Web crawler

The purpose of the crawler is to fetch the data from websites. In this tutorial I'm using my blog as an example dataset. For simplicity, I will supply a sitemap - a list of urls - to the the crawler so that it can directly fetch the data.

We are making use of beautifulsoup library for Python.

```python
hello_world = 'sfsd'
```
